How do you ask for feedback from colleagues examples?
Image result for how to ask for private feedback from colleagues example
I'm looking to enhance my performance at work, I'd really appreciate it if you'd be willing to give me some honest and open feedback on some of the work I do, is that possible? If your coworker seems open to providing feedback, go on to explain: I'll always let you know in advance what I'm hoping to get feedback on.


Hi Leif,



coming to code walk through meeting, I didn't have much time to prepare for it and meeting was scheduled unexpectedly initially i planned to arrange the meeting on Tuesday but due to new thesis students are joining on Monday and most of us will be busy, I have scheduled on Friday. I will keep this in mind for next meetings and be prepared.








Hi Marcus, as per what you mentioned in the call about that

I agree with that but I think,

(I)coming to the code walkthrough meeting, As you know that I didn't have much time to prepare for it and the meeting was scheduled unexpectedly initially I planned to arrange the meeting on Tuesday but due to new thesis students are joining on Monday and most of us will be busy, I have scheduled on Friday and didn't have time for it and came to the meeting without a proper plan. I will keep this in mind for the next meetings and be prepared.



Regarding code context.

(II)Definitely. I already try understanding the context that a method fits into. I probably need to broaden the context but this would definitely take a lot of time given the code base is humongous & which I thought would not allow us to meet our goals in the stipulated time. So, I tried narrowing the context a bit & learn the broader context as I code in other classes & modules. Let me know your suggestions here.


Thanks for your mail, I just saw that the discussion meeting has been set to Friday this week. But I have some other work that needs my presence this week Friday. Sorry for not being able to have our discussion on Friday.

And you also mentioned it's okay for you after Tuesday next week to have to meeting in our previous conversation. 

I can have the meeting any day next week starting from August 2nd. 

Please confirm me the timings and the day that is okay to you ðŸ˜€ !
