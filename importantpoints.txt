While pursuing my masters at BTH, I also worked as a ProjectEngineer at the Husqvarna AB group where I was primarily responsible to developa machine learning-based application to detect the usage patterns oflawnmowers. We faced multiple challenges such as scaling to model usingreal-time data, the need for implementation of robust testing methods andsuccessfully overcame them in a very short period. Interning at theseorganizations provided me with the opportunity to put my coding knowledge inreal-time environments and made me face a few challenges such as adapting tovarious work cultures, exploring new technologies & frameworks, identifying& resolving bugs and bottlenecks, etc. In all the internships we worked on,I’ve demonstrated my ability to hit deadlines, strong attention to detail, andimplement production-ready code.
