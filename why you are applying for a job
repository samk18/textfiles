The reason why I want to move out from Ericsson is I am not given big features to work on, getting small features to work on. and I felt it is not using my abilities to the fullest or challenging me enough and no longer finding the work fulfilling or enjoying my work as much.
I am looking for an opportunity where I can put my skills to the best possible use. I hope this position will full fill my requirements and drive my career forward.

list<int> gqlist1, gqlist2;

 gqlist1.push_back(i * 2) push element at back
gqlist2.push_front(i * 3) push element at front

 gqlist1.front() get first element
 gqlist1.back(); get last element

 gqlist1.pop_front() pop front
gqlist2.pop_back() pop back

// pop the first element at queue
